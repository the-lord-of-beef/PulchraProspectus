- Removed problematic mods:
	OptiFine 1.8.x/1.19.x
	Optifine 1.19.2 Crash Fix
	Stalwart Dungeons
	Monster Plus

These mods have been made obsolete by mods that accomplish the same things, but result in less problems.

- Added new mods:
	Cave Spider Spawn
	Damage Tilt
	Easier Sleeping
	Embeddium
	Equipment Compare [Neo/Forge]
	FerriteCore ((Neo)Forge)
	Iceberg [Neo/Forge]

	Kotlin for Forge
	libIPN
	Maxwell The Carryable Cat
	Oculus
	Pehkui
	Vex Remodel
	Collective

Compared to the total new mods recently added, these are some of the most unremarkable. This is so the server can be updated without needing a restart.

- Updated mod resources:
	alexsmobs
	aquamirae
	cave_dweller

	create_confectionery

	Fish of Thieves

The main feature added with these resources is more eating animations. This is in addition to a slew of other changes, which is at the moment too long to easily list.

The Pulchra Customs resource pack has been moved to the required resources folder, and removed the original resource packs folder from the pack. This will enable the resources by default.

Removed the SEUS Renewed Shaders. These have been replaced with the Complementary Unbound shaders. These fix a variety of visual issues present in SEUS shaders and Optifine, and in my opinion they are more beautiful.


There are many, many more changes in the works. This version will likely have problems, so please keep filing suggestions in the Feedback document.
